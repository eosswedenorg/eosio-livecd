Welcome to eosio livecd.

This xubuntu desktop version comes preloaded
with some nice software like:

* cleos-v2
* eosio-keygen
* keepassxc
* achor wallet

along with other standard tools.

Firewall (ufw) is enabled and blocks all
incoming and outgoing traffic per default (except for outgoing DNS and HTTPS).

Consult: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW if you need to configure it.
